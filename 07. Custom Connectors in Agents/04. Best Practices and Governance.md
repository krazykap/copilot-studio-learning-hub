# 04. Best Practices and Governance

As you build and deploy Custom Connectors in Copilot Studio, it's essential to follow best practices and governance guidelines to ensure security, maintainability, and compliance. Here are some key considerations:

## 🧩 Why Governance Matters
With great power comes great responsibility. Custom Connectors can access sensitive data and perform critical operations, making it vital to implement governance practices that protect your organization and its users.
Without proper governance:
- Data breaches could occur
- Non-compliance with regulations may lead to legal issues
- Operational risks could increase due to misconfigurations or unauthorized access
- Maintenance challenges may arise from poorly documented or unmanaged connectors

With governance in place, you can ensure that your connectors are secure, reliable, and aligned with organizational policies.



## ✅ Best Practices

🔏 **Secure your authentication credentials**
- Use environment variables or secure vaults to store API keys and secrets.
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in your connector definitions.
- Prefer OAuth 2.0 for user-level access and sensitive data.

📦 **Modularise and reuse**
- Design connectors to be modular and reusable across different agents and scenarios.
- Leverage shared libraries or templates for common functionalities.
- Avoid duplication of logic to simplify maintenance.

📃 **Comprehensive documentation**
- Document the purpose, endpoints, authentication methods, and usage examples for each connector.
- Maintain an up-to-date knowledge base for your team to reference.
- Include versioning information to track changes over time.
- Use clear and consistent naming conventions for connectors and their components.
- Include examples of how to use the connector in different scenarios.

🔁 **Version Control**
- Use version control systems (e.g., Git) to manage changes to your connector definitions.
- Tag releases and maintain a changelog to track updates and fixes.
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible to avoid breaking existing integrations.

🧪 **Test Thoroughly**
- Implement unit and integration tests to validate connector functionality.
- Use mock data to simulate API responses during testing.
- Simulate real-world scenarios to ensure reliability.

📊 **Monitor usage**
- Track API usage and performance metrics to identify potential issues.
- Set up alerts for unusual activity or errors.

🚫 **Error Handling**
- Implement robust error handling to manage API failures gracefully.
- Provide meaningful error messages to aid in troubleshooting.
- Log errors for future analysis and improvement.

## 🏢 Governance strategies

🔏 **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- Define roles and permissions for users who can create, modify, or deploy Custom Connectors.
- Restrict access to sensitive connectors based on user roles.
- Use Power Platform environments to separate development, testing, and production stages.

📄 **Compliance and Auditing**
- Ensure that your connectors comply with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
- Maintain audit logs of connector usage and changes for accountability.
- Regularly review and update connectors to ensure ongoing compliance.

🧠 **Connector Registry**
- Maintain a centralized registry of approved Custom Connectors.
- Review and approve new connectors before deployment.

## Our own example: CurrencyBeacon Connector
| Governance Area                   | Implementation                    |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Authentication					| API Key stored in environment variable |
| Versioning						| v1.0.0 ➡️ v1.1.0 (add support for rounding) |
| Documentation                     | Action: `Convert`, Parameters: `amount`, `from`, `to` |
| Monitoring                        | Track API usage via Power Platform Analytics and CurrencyBeacon dashboard |

## Conclusion
Custom connectors are not just about functionality; they are about building secure, reliable, and compliant integrations.
By adhering to best practices and governance guidelines, you can build robust, secure, and compliant Custom Connectors in Copilot Studio. This not only enhances the functionality of your conversational agents but also ensures that they operate within the bounds of organizational policies and industry standards.

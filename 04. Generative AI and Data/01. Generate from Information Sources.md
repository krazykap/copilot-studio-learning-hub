# 01. Generate from Information Sources

The landscape of AI Copilots is rapidly evolving. Traditionally, building a Copilot involved meticulously crafting "topics" – pre-defined workflows that dictate the Copilot's responses based on specific user queries. While effective for structured interactions, this approach presents significant challenges, particularly for complex or constantly changing information. Imagine an HR chatbot requiring a separate topic for every policy change, or a customer service bot needing manual updates for every new product feature. This "manual topic creation" quickly becomes a bottleneck, demanding constant human intervention for updates and expansions.

## The Dawn of Knowledge-Based Copilots
Enter generative AI and the power of knowledge sources. The modern approach to Copilot development leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate intelligent and contextually relevant answers directly from provided information. Instead of painstakingly designing every possible conversational path, you can now feed your Copilot a vast repository of data, and it will intelligently retrieve, synthesize, and present information. This paradigm shift dramatically accelerates Copilot creation and ensures answers are always up-to-date.

### How it Works: Information as a Knowledge Base
At its core, this method allows you to "ground" your Copilot in specific data. When a user asks a question, the Copilot, powered by generative AI, searches through this knowledge base to formulate a coherent and accurate response. This eliminates the need for exhaustive topic creation and manual updates. If the underlying information changes, the Copilot automatically adapts, providing the latest insights without any re-programming.

## Diverse Information Sources for Powerful Copilots
Copilot platforms are increasingly supporting a wide array of information sources, enabling unparalleled flexibility in how you equip your AI assistant. Here's a glimpse of the currently supported sources:
- **Bing Search:** For publicly available information, you can point your Copilot to public URLs, allowing it to leverage the vastness of the internet.
- **Knowledge Bases:** Upload structured data in formats like CSV, Excel, or JSON. This is ideal for scenarios where you have specific datasets that your Copilot needs to reference.
- **Custom APIs:** If you have proprietary data or services, you can connect your Copilot to custom APIs, enabling it to fetch real-time information from your systems.
- **Azure OpenAI on your data:** This powerful option allows you to deploy advanced AI models like GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 on your own proprietary data. This means your Copilot can provide accurate and compliant answers based on your internal documents and databases, without the need for external data exposure.
- **Documents Uploaded to Dataverse:** Easily upload various document types, such as PDFs and Word files, directly to Dataverse. Your Copilot can then process and extract information from these uploaded files.
- **SharePoint:** For organizations that store a wealth of information on SharePoint team sites, Copilots can directly connect to these sites, accessing documents, lists, and other content. This includes the ability to integrate with SharePoint lists for structured, tabular data.
- **OneDrive for Business:** Similar to SharePoint, connecting to OneDrive for Business allows your Copilot to access files and folders, synchronizing changes automatically for real-time information.
- **Custom Data:** For unique data sources, Copilots offer flexibility. You can either specify custom data directly within the Copilot configuration or, more powerfully, create actions that retrieve data from external systems like databases. This opens up possibilities for real-time data queries and dynamic information retrieval.

## The Benefits: Efficiency, Accuracy, and Scalability
The advantages of this knowledge-based approach are significant:
- **Rapid Development:** Create functional Copilots much faster by eliminating the need for extensive topic authoring.
- **Always Up-to-Date:** Information changes are automatically reflected in the Copilot's responses, reducing maintenance overhead.
- **Enhanced Accuracy:** Answers are grounded in actual data, leading to more precise and reliable responses.
- **Scalability:** Easily expand your Copilot's capabilities by adding new information sources without reworking existing topics.
- **Reduced Manual Effort:** Free up developers and content creators from the repetitive task of manually updating conversational flows.
- **User Empowerment:** Users can ask questions in natural language, and the Copilot will intelligently retrieve and present the most relevant information, enhancing user experience.

## Conclusion and Future Directions
The shift from manual topic creation to knowledge-based Copilots represents a significant leap forward in AI assistant development. By leveraging generative AI and diverse information sources, you can create powerful, intelligent Copilots that adapt to user needs in real-time. This approach not only streamlines the development process but also ensures that your Copilot remains relevant and effective as information evolves.

While incredibly powerful, it's important to be aware of certain considerations. For instance, public Bing search is limited to public URLs, and specific data connectors might have their own limitations regarding the number of sources or authentication requirements. However, the continuous evolution of generative AI and co-pilot platforms promises even more sophisticated capabilities and broader integration options in the future.

By leveraging information as a dynamic knowledge source, co-pilots are transforming from rigid, rule-based systems into intelligent, adaptive assistants, capable of providing on-demand, accurate information with unprecedented ease. This marks a significant leap forward in the efficiency and utility of AI in various domains, from HR and customer service to complex data analysis.

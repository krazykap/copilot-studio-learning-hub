# 02. Custom Prompts

## What are Custom Prompts?
Custom prompts are tailored instructions or context specifically designed to guide an AI model's responses in a particular way. Unlike generic prompts, custom prompts are crafted to address specific tasks, scenarios, or user needs, allowing for more precise and relevant interactions with the AI.

At its core, a custom prompt in **Copilot Studio** is a tailored set of instructions that you provide to the underlying generative AI model. Unlike pre-defined conversational flows, custom prompts allow you to leverage the natural language understanding and generation capabilities of AI to address specific tasks or answer complex questions. Think of it as directly telling the AI what you want it to do or say, rather than relying solely on predefined keywords and triggers.

When a user interacts with a copilot that utilizes a custom prompt, their input, along with the instructions defined in the prompt, is sent to the AI model. The model then processes this information and generates a response based on the prompt's guidance and its vast knowledge base. This allows for much more dynamic and context-aware interactions than traditional rule-based chatbots.

### Why to Use Custom Prompts?
Integrating custom prompts into your Copilot Studio projects offers a multitude of benefits, significantly enhancing the value and effectiveness of your virtual agent:
1. **Enhanced Relevance and Accuracy:** By crafting specific instructions and providing relevant context within the prompt, you can significantly improve the accuracy and relevance of the AI's responses. This ensures that users receive information that directly addresses their needs, reducing frustration and improving satisfaction.
1. **Tailored to Specific Business Needs:** Every organization has unique requirements and processes. Custom prompts allow you to create AI-powered solutions that are precisely aligned with your specific business use cases, whether it's answering industry-specific questions, summarizing internal documents, or guiding users through complex workflows.
1. **Maintaining Brand Voice and Tone:** Custom prompts can be designed to instruct the AI to adopt a specific tone of voice that aligns with your brand identity. This ensures a consistent and professional user experience across all interactions with your copilot.
1. **Handling Complex Queries:** Unlike traditional chatbots that might struggle with nuanced or multi-part questions, generative AI powered by well-crafted custom prompts can often understand and respond effectively to more complex inquiries.
1. **Increased Efficiency and Automation:** By automating the response to frequently asked questions or routine tasks through custom prompts, you can free up human agents to focus on more complex and critical issues, leading to increased efficiency and reduced operational costs.
1. **Flexibility and Adaptability:** Custom prompts offer a high degree of flexibility. You can easily modify and refine prompts to adapt to changing information, new requirements, or feedback from users, ensuring your copilot remains up-to-date and effective.
1. **Improved User Engagement:** A copilot that provides accurate, relevant, and context-aware responses is more likely to engage users effectively. This can lead to higher user satisfaction, increased usage, and better overall outcomes for your AI initiatives.

### When to Use Custom Prompts?
Custom prompts are particularly beneficial in scenarios where:
1. **Specific Domain Knowledge is Required:** If your copilot needs to provide information or assistance in a specialized field (e.g., legal, medical, technical support), custom prompts can help ensure the AI understands and responds appropriately to domain-specific queries.
1. **Complex Interactions are Expected:** For use cases involving multi-step processes, detailed explanations, or nuanced conversations, custom prompts can guide the AI to handle these interactions more effectively.
1. **Brand Consistency is Important:** When maintaining a consistent brand voice and tone is crucial for user experience, custom prompts can help achieve this by instructing the AI on how to communicate.
1. **Dynamic and Evolving Content:** If the information your copilot needs to provide is frequently updated or changes based on context, custom prompts allow for easy adjustments to keep responses relevant.
1. **High User Expectations:** In scenarios where users expect high-quality, accurate, and context-aware responses (e.g., customer support, knowledge management), custom prompts can help meet these expectations.
1. **Personalized User Experiences:** When you want to create personalized interactions based on user preferences, history, or behavior, custom prompts can be tailored to deliver a more individualized experience.
1. **Integration with Other Systems:** If your copilot needs to interact with other systems, databases, or APIs, custom prompts can be designed to facilitate these interactions and ensure the AI provides accurate and relevant information.

## Anatomy of an Effective Prompt
While interacting with an AI might feel like a natural conversation, crafting effective custom prompts requires a structured approach. A well-designed prompt typically includes several key components:
1. **The Goal (Instruction):** This is the core of your prompt and clearly states what you want the AI to do. Be direct and unambiguous. For example, instead of "Tell me about your features," a clearer goal would be "Summarize the key features of the premium Copilot Studio plan in three bullet points."
1. **The Context:** Providing relevant background information helps the AI understand the user's intent and generate a more accurate response. This might include details about the user, the topic of conversation, or any relevant data. For example, if the goal is to recommend a product, the context could include the user's past purchase history or stated preferences.
1. **The Constraints (Parameters):** These are the rules or limitations you set for the AI's response. Constraints can include the desired format (e.g., bullet points, a numbered list, a paragraph), the length of the response, the tone (e.g., formal, informal, friendly), or specific keywords that should or should not be included.
1. **The Source (Optional but Recommended):** In many cases, you'll want the AI to base its response on specific data sources. This could be a link to a webpage, a snippet of text, or data retrieved from a connected system. By providing a source, you guide the AI to use reliable and up-to-date information. For example, "Based on the following article: [link to article], summarize the main findings."

Think of crafting a prompt like giving a detailed instruction to a helpful assistant. The more clarity and context you provide, the better the assistant (in this case, the AI model) can understand your needs and deliver the desired outcome.

## Classic Prompting vs. Few-Shot Prompting Vs Role-based Prompts
When designing custom prompts, you can choose between:
### Classic Prompting
Classic prompting involves providing a single, clear instruction to the AI model without additional examples. This approach is straightforward and works well for simple tasks where the desired outcome is unambiguous. For instance, a classic prompt might be: "List the top five benefits of using cloud computing."
### Few-Shot Prompting
Few-shot prompting, on the other hand, involves providing the AI with a few examples of the desired output along with the instruction. This method is particularly useful for more complex tasks or when you want to guide the AI's style and format. For example, a few-shot prompt might look like this:

Here is examples of product reviews:
````
Generate a rhyming couplet for the word provided.

Input: "cat"
Output: The curious cat, so sleek and fat,
Curled up cozy on the welcome mat.

Input: "sky"
Output: Look up high into the endless sky,
Where birds and clouds go drifting by.

Input: "moon"
Output:
````
````
Output: In the dead of night, the glowing moon, Casts its soft light across the lagoon.
````

Few-shot prompting helps the AI understand the context and format you expect, leading to more consistent and relevant responses.

### Role-based Prompts
These prompts instruct the AI to adopt a specific persona or role. This can influence the style and content of the generated response. For example: "Act as a friendly customer service agent and answer the following question: What are your operating hours?"

## Conclusion
In conclusion, custom prompts are a powerful feature within Copilot Studio that unlock the true potential of generative AI for building intelligent and engaging copilots. By understanding what they are, why they are important, and the fundamental elements of an effective prompt, you are taking the first crucial step towards creating sophisticated AI-powered solutions.

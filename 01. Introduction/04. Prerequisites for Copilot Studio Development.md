# 04. Prerequisites for Copilot Studio Development
To embark on your journey with Copilot Studio development, ensuring you have the necessary access is paramount. This guide outlines the prerequisites and steps to gain access to Copilot Studio, covering scenarios for both new and existing Microsoft 365 users.

**Here’s how you can secure that access:**

## Scenario 1: You have a Microsoft 365 Account (Work or Small Business)
If your workplace or small business already utilizes Microsoft 365 (including Outlook, Teams, Word, PowerPoint), you likely have a Microsoft 365 account. In this case, you simply need to add a Copilot Studio license to your existing account.
#### Steps to Add a Copilot Studio License:
- **Access the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:** Go to  admin center. You might need an administrator to perform this step if you don't have the necessary permissions. <pre>admin.microsoft.com</pre>
- **Navigate to Billing:** In the left-hand menu, select "Billing" and then "Purchase services."
- **Find Copilot Studio License:** Search for "Copilot Studio" in the available services.
- **Obtain the License:** Follow the prompts to purchase the Copilot Studio license for your account.
- **Assign the License:**
	- Once the license is acquired, go to "Users" > "Active users" in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.
	- Select the user (likely yourself) to whom you want to assign the license.
	- Go to "Licenses and Apps" and check the box next to "Copilot Studio Viral Trial" (or the Copilot Studio license you just acquired).
	- Alternatively, from the "Licenses" section in the admin center, select the "Copilot Studio Viral Trial" license and click "Assign License." Then, search for and select the user's name and click "Assign".

## Scenario 2: You DO NOT Have a Microsoft 365 Account
- **Create a Microsoft 365 Business Standard Account:**
	- Go to microsoft.com and search for "Microsoft 365 business" or directly navigate to the relevant URL.
	- Scroll down and select "Microsoft 365 Business Standard." This particular version is recommended as you might utilize Copilot for Microsoft 365 in conjunction with Copilot Studio.
	- Click on "Try Free for one month" (or the equivalent free trial offer).
	- Fill in your details, including your email address, to complete the sign-up process for the one-month free trial.
	- This step provides you with a Microsoft 365 Business account, which is essential for proceeding.
- **Follow Steps from Scenario 1 to Add Copilot Studio License:** Once you have your Microsoft 365 Business Standard account, you can follow the steps outlined in "Scenario 1: You have a Microsoft 365 Account" to acquire and assign the Copilot Studio license within your newly created admin center.

## Verifying Your Copilot Studio Access
After following the steps above, you can verify your access to Copilot Studio:
- **Access Copilot Studio:** Open your web browser and go to copilotstudio.microsoft.com.
- **Sign In:** Use your Microsoft 365 account credentials to sign in.
- **Check for Copilot Studio Features:** Once signed in, you should see the Copilot Studio interface and features available for development.

## Alternative Verification (for Existing Microsoft 365 Users):
If you already have a Microsoft 365 Business account and want to quickly verify Copilot Studio access, you can:
- Go directly to copilotstudio.microsoft.com or copilotstudio.preview.microsoft.com.
- Alternatively, visit the Copilot Studio landing page and click "Try Free." This will attempt to log you in and confirm your access.
- If you encounter any issues, ensure that your account has the Copilot Studio license assigned as per the steps outlined above.

If you've reached the Copilot Studio homepage, congratulations! You're all set to begin your Copilot Studio development journey. If you encounter any issues or do not see the expected homepage, it's likely due to either not having a Microsoft 365 Business account or missing the Copilot Studio license assignment. In such cases, review the steps above or seek assistance.

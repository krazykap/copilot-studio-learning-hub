# 01. Idea behind Copilot Studio
Microsoft recognized that even more impact could be achieved by enabling users to create their own custom Copilots. This led to the development of Copilot Studio, which is part of Microsoft's Power Platform (alongside Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power Pages).
**Copilot Studio** empowers users to build personalized and customized AI assistants for their specific business needs. These custom Copilots can:
- Answer questions by reading organizational data.
- Perform actions.
- Serve as internal tools for employees or external tools for customer service.

Previously known as **Power Virtual Agents**, Copilot Studio provides a platform for creating highly relevant and impactful generative AI applications tailored to individual or organizational requirements.
- **Increased Productivity with Generative AI:** Generative AI significantly boosts productivity at work, a fact supported by numerous studies from Microsoft and other research firms. This technology helps users complete tasks faster and more efficiently.
- **Advancements in Generative AI Technology:** There have been rapid and significant advancements in generative AI. While earlier models like GPT-3 and 3.5 primarily generated text, newer models such as GPT-4 and those from Cohere, Anthropic (Opus), and Meta can not only generate text but also provide more sophisticated answers and produce images (e.g., Midjourney, DALL-E). These large language models have surpassed initial expectations.
- **The Power of Personalized Generative AI:** The more personalized and specific a generative AI tool is, the more effective it becomes. General models like ChatGPT are powerful, but they lack knowledge of an individual's specific business, work processes, terminology, or access to internal data (like emails and files).

**Microsoft Copilot** addresses this by integrating the power of ChatGPT with an organization's internal data, making it accessible within daily tools such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams. This allows the AI to provide highly relevant and contextual answers.

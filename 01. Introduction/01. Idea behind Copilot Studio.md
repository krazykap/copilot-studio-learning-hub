# 01. Idea behind Copilot Studio
Microsoft recognized that even more impact could be achieved by enabling users to create their own custom Copilots. This led to the development of Copilot Studio, which is part of Microsoft's Power Platform (alongside Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power Pages).
**Copilot Studio** empowers users to build personalized and customized AI assistants for their specific business needs. These custom Copilots can:
- Answer questions by reading organizational data.
- Perform actions.
- Serve as internal tools for employees or external tools for customer service.

Previously known as **Power Virtual Agents**, Copilot Studio provides a platform for creating highly relevant and impactful generative AI applications tailored to individual or organizational requirements.

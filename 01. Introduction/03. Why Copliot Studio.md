# 03. Why Copilot Studio?
You might be wondering why organizations are investing in building copilots and chatbots, and why you should learn about Copilot Studio. The answer is simple: **generative AI, especially when customized, is the most effective way to boost productivity across your organization**.
We've seen how generative AI can significantly accelerate workflows. While general chatbots offer some benefits, customized copilots truly shine because they're tailored to your specific needs and data. This personalization is key to unlocking their full potential and is why copilots and chatbots are poised to revolutionize productivity.
Microsoft has observed these tools being used in a wide array of business functions, including:
- **Sales support:** Quickly providing information to sales teams.
- **Customer service:** Handling common customer queries and support issues.
- **Operational information:** Offering details on opening hours and store information.
- **HR support:** Answering questions about employee health, vacation benefits, and common HR policies.
- **Public health tracking:** Disseminating crucial health information.

The core idea is to offload routine, time-consuming tasks from human employees to a copilot or chatbot. Even if a copilot can only complete 90% of a task, leaving the remaining 10% for human intervention, the efficiency gains are substantial.

Consider the example of **employee health and vacation benefits**. In many organizations, HR personnel spend countless hours processing vacation requests, answering questions about policies, booking days, and seeking approvals. Imagine if a copilot could automate even 20% of this work, let alone 90%! Instead of an HR person manually taking a request, processing it, finding a manager, getting approval, and then notifying the employee, a copilot could handle it all. Employees could simply ask the copilot: "How many vacation days do I have left?" "What's my vacation policy?" or "How many days do I earn a year?" This significantly reduces emails and saves valuable time for HR staff.

Before the advent of GPT and generative AI, building effective chatbots was incredibly difficult, often limited to rigid question-and-answer formats without the ability to perform actions or automations. But now, with generative AI, interacting with a copilot is akin to speaking with a human who possesses deep knowledge of, for example, your company's vacation policies through readily available documentation.

This shift is why we're seeing the rise of copilots and chatbots. They are built to make businesses more efficient, save people time, and empower users to accomplish 0% to 80% of tasks they would typically need human assistance for. In the next five years, it's highly probable that copilots will automate 50% to 80% of tasks for most employees within an organization. This is a game-changer for productivity and operational efficiency.
